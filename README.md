## About

* Four FM operators with parameters for volume, panning, modulation index, feedback, frequency modifiers (ratio, free and fine), envelope values (attack, decay, release) and toggling of white noise mode.
* Flexible routing allows setting the operator modulation target (with some limitations) as well as the percentage of signal that is simply added to the final output, enabling additive synthesis.
* Four LFOs with multiple waveforms, oneshot and loop modes and optional DAW BPM sync. They can target most operator parameters and most parameters of lower-index LFOs.
* Each operator is connected to an attack-decay-sustain-release volume envelope with logarithmic slopes.
* Per-operator white noise mode makes it easy to create percussive sounds such as hi-hats and cymbals.
* Runs on macOS, Windows 10 and Linux (X11) in VST2-compatible DAWs on 64-bit computers. Synthesis is SIMD-accelerated in many cases (SSE2, AVX).
* Master volume and master frequency parameters
* 128 voices (using them all simultaneously might consume quite a bit of CPU time though)
* Fully automatable

## Installation

Please refer to <a href="https://www.octasine.com">OctaSine.com</a>.

## Installation from source code

### macOS

If you already have any of the software mentioned below, that step can be skipped.

1. [Install the Rust compiler](https://rustup.rs/). Choose the nightly toolchain when prompted. Requires the XCode build tools from Apple, you will probably be prompted to install those.

2. [Install homebrew](https://brew.sh).

3. Install git and cmake with homebrew:

```sh
brew install git cmake
```

4. Clone this repository to a folder on your computer:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/Downloads"
cd "$HOME/Downloads"
git clone https://github.com/greatest-ape/OctaSine.git
cd OctaSine
```

5. Unless you want to use the bleeding edge development branch, switch to the latest stable version, e.g.:

```sh
git checkout tags/v0.5.4
```

6. Build and install:

```sh
./scripts/macos/build-simd-and-install.sh
```

### Windows

If you already have any of the software mentioned below, that step can be skipped.

1. Install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Make sure that the Windows 10 SDK and the English language pack components are included during installation.
2. [Install the Rust compiler](https://rustup.rs/). When prompted, choose the nightly toolchain and to modify the path variable.
3. Install [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/). When prompted, choose the option to add cmake to the system executable path.
4. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
5. Clone this repository to a folder on your computer, enter it.

6. Unless you want to use the bleeding edge development branch, switch to the latest stable version, e.g.:

```sh
git checkout tags/v0.5.4
```

7. Build OctaSine:

```cmd
cargo +nightly build --release --features "simd" -p octasine_vst2_plugin
```

8. Copy `target\release\octasine.dll` to your VST plugin folder.

### Linux

If you already have any of the software mentioned below, that step can be skipped.

1. [Install the Rust compiler](https://rustup.rs/). Choose the nightly toolchain when prompted. 
2. Install dependencies, e.g.,

```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake git build-essential libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxcb-dri2-0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libx11-xcb-dev 
```

You might need to install llvm/clang dependencies too, e.g.,

```sh
sudo apt-get install llvm clang
```

On Debian 10, you might need to install some more dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libfreetype6-dev libexpat1-dev
```

3. Clone this repository to a folder on your computer, e.g.,

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/Downloads"
cd "$HOME/Downloads"
git clone https://github.com/greatest-ape/OctaSine.git
cd OctaSine
```

4. Unless you want to use the bleeding edge development branch, switch to the latest stable version, e.g.:

```sh
git checkout tags/v0.5.4
```

5. Build the OctaSine plugin:

```sh
cargo +nightly build --release --features "simd" -p octasine_vst2_plugin
```

If build fails, please try building without sleef SIMD acceleration:

```sh
cargo +nightly build --release -p octasine_vst2_plugin
```

6. Copy `target/release/liboctasine.so` to your VST plugin folder
